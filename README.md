## üìö Introduction

This project is a part of the "DIO Santander Bootcamp 2023 - Fullstack Java+Angular." It's a fork from the [digitalinnovationone/js-developer-pokedex](https://github.com/digitalinnovationone/js-developer-pokedex) with the main goal to enhance the original work by adding a detailed section displaying a Pok√©mon's attributes.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

Since this project uses Vanilla JS, you can simply:

1. Clone this repository

git clone https://github.com/marcelorvergara/js-developer-pokedex.git

2. Deploy it on any HTTP server.

## üåü Future Improvements

- **Device Compatibility**: The detail page is currently optimized for mobile devices only. Future updates could potentially expand this to include desktop and tablets.

- **Design**: While functional, the design can be refined further. Note that the main focus of this project was the application of JavaScript to add interactive behavior to HTML.
