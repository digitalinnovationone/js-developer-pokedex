                <strong>Introduction</strong>
                <p>This project is a component of the "DIO Santander Bootcamp 2023 - Fullstack Java+Angular."</p>

<p>Originating from a fork of the digitalinnovationone/js-developer-pokedex project, its primary aim is to enhance the original work by introducing a detailed section showcasing the attributes of a Pok√©mon.</p>

<strong>Installation</strong>

<p>Given that this project utilizes Vanilla JS, simply download the repository and deploy it on any HTTP server.</p>

<strong>Areas for Improvement</strong>

<p>Device Compatibility: Currently, the details page is optimized solely for mobile devices. Future iterations could potentially expand this compatibility to encompass desktops and tablets.</p>

<p>Design: While functional, there's room for design refinement. However, it's pertinent to note that the primary focus of this project was the application of Javascript to imbue the HTML with interactive behavior.</p>
